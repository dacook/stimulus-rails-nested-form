## Getting started
### Node
Ensure you have a compatible node version mentioned in `.node-version`

Note, `nodenv` doesn't recognise a non-specific version, so you'll have to set it manually with env var (or better, .node-version should be updated)

### Packages
Using yarn package manager:
`yarn install`

### Running tests
Optionally specify file or folder for a specific test.
`yarn jest [path]`

### Dev server
`yarn run dev`
